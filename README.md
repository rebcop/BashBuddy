## My process

### Built with

- CSS and Bootstrap Layout
- JavaScript Fundamentals
- JavaScript Loops
- JavaScript DOM Manipulation
- Async JavaScript Functions
- JavaScript Fetch & API Usage
- TECH STACK: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap

### What I learned

1. Use map to easily create an array of a spcific property from an array of objects.
2. Use set to provide an array that only contains unique values.
3. localStorage.setItem() & localStorage.getItem() allows for storing and then getting information in the browser as a JSON for an undetermined amount of time. This stoarge can be viewed and modified by anyone who has access to the same browserthe information was stored in.

### Possible Improvements
1. Ability to delete one / all events.
2. Ability to filter by Event Name / Type, Date.
3. Set up initial data with an API.
